&lt;p>This blog was &lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/ci-cd-improvements/">originally posted by 2i2c&lt;/a> and represents a project Sarah lead and developed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>2i2c manages the configuration and deployment of multiple Kubernetes clusters and JupyterHubs from &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure">a single open infrastructure repository&lt;/a>.
This is a challenging problem, as it requires us to centralize information about a number of &lt;em>independent&lt;/em> cloud services, and deploy them in an efficient and reliable manner.
Our initial attempt at this had a number of inefficiencies, and we recently completed an overhaul of its configuration and deployment infrastructure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things I've Learned: January 2022</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/til-jan22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/til-jan22/</guid><description>An Unordered Collection of Things I Learn over a Month</description></item><item><title>How I automated authorised cloud deployments from Pull Requests with GitHub Actions</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/test-this-pr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 19:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/test-this-pr/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>I recently did some work on the mybinder.org deployment infrastructure to solve a problem with testing Pull Requests before deployment.
It had not been possible to test Pull Requests on our staging deployment because our automated workflows don&amp;rsquo;t have access to secrets.
This resulted in my writing the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sgibson91/test-this-pr-action">&lt;code>test-this-pr&lt;/code> action&lt;/a> and this blog is a retrospective of what I learned over that process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Create a Blog with Hugo and GitHub Pages</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/hugo-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:28:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/hugo-tutorial/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a scientist in today&amp;rsquo;s ever connected, digital world, having a platform to talk about one&amp;rsquo;s work can be a really useful tool.
Whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking to strike up new collaborations or promote your freshly published paper, a blog can help signal boost your work and function as an archive of your ideas (the developed and forgotten).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I put together a tutorial for building a blog site from scratch using &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages&lt;/a> - the same tools I use to host this site!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Collaborations Workshop 2021</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/collabw21/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 19:13:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/collabw21/</guid><description>A Summary of #CollabW21</description></item><item><title>Continuous Integration: Fail Fast and Fail First</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/continuous-integration/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/continuous-integration/</guid><description>How to industry and academia take advantage of shared tools</description></item><item><title>February 2020 Update</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/february-2020-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/february-2020-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello friends! &amp;#x1f44b;
It feels like such a long time since I wrote a blog post but the truth is that I&amp;rsquo;ve just been up to so many exciting things!
So this blog post will be a quick run down on everything I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to recently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the start of January, I helped organise and run the &lt;a href="https://research-software-reactor.github.io/">Research Software Reactor&lt;/a> with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ixek">Tania Allard&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gerardjgorman">Gerard Gorman&lt;/a>.
Our topic was &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://research-software-reactor.github.io/blog/devops4rse">DevOps for better software and research reproducibility&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;.
We had around 30 attendees come together at the Turing Institute for 2 days and learn about &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions&lt;/a> for automating their workflows.
The aim was to produce reproducible software to support gold-standard research.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship 2020</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/ssi-fellowship/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/ssi-fellowship/</guid><description>&lt;p>So 2020 is off to an incredibly exciting start!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I have been awarded a Software Sustainability Institute 2020 Fellowship!!!&lt;/strong> &amp;#x1f389; &amp;#x1f389; &amp;#x1f389;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://software.ac.uk">Software Sustainability Institute&lt;/a> (SSI) is an organisation that facilitates the advancement of software in research by cultivating better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research (“Better software, better research”).
Its mission is to become the world-leading hub for research software practice.
The Institute is based at the Universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford and Southampton, and draws on a team of experts with a breadth of experience in software development, project and programme management, research facilitation, publicity and community engagement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2019: Seasons of Reflection</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/seasons-of-reflection/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/seasons-of-reflection/</guid><description>&lt;p>As 2019 comes to a close, I have spent a full year as a Research Software Engineer (RSE) at The Alan Turing Institute.
A lot has changed over the last 12 months and I&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way - sometimes surprising myself!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="winter-snowflake">Winter &amp;#x2744;&amp;#xfe0f;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In February, I gave my first professional talk at the &lt;a href="https://cloud.ac.uk/workshops/feb2019/">UKRI Cloud Working Group workshop&lt;/a> hosted by The Francis Crick Institute.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the furthest I&amp;rsquo;ve travelled for a conference giving it&amp;rsquo;s next door to the British Library, but it was certainly good practice!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diving Into Leadership to Build Push-Button Code</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/diving-into-leadership/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/diving-into-leadership/</guid><description>Sarah's experiences at the Microsoft Reactor Sprint 2019</description></item></channel></rss>

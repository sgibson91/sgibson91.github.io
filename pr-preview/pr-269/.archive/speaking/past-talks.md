I have spoken on reproducible research and open source collaboration at high profile software conferences in the UK and globally for virtual conferences.
I also lead workshops and tutorials on Binder for all ranges of abilities both in-person and remotely.

I am always happy to attend and speak at conferences, and I really enjoy sharing my knowledge with new audiences.
I am grateful to all the conference organisers who have done a wonderful job hosting me so far. :open_hands:

If you would like me to speak at your event, please make sure to read my [speaker rider]({{< relref "/speaking/speaker-rider" >}}) before contacting me.

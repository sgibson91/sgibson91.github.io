[Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a project that allows users to create custom computing environments that can be shared and used by many remote users. It is powered by [BinderHub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is an open-source tool that deploys the Binder service in the cloud.

One such Binder service is [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) and is free to use. More information about mybinder.org and the team that runs is can be found on the ["About mybinder.org"](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html#about) page.

As a member of the Binder operating team, Sarah's role involves maintaining the mybinder.org website, responding to issues and/or contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub) and in the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/binder), and providing documentation.

Sarah is also the Microsoft Azure expert when it comes to deploying BinderHubs and has written a [step-by-step workshop](https://bit.ly/zero-to-binderhub-workshop) that teaches others to do this. She has deployed and maintains a private BinderHub instance at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), known as [Hub23](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/hub23-deploy), hosted on Azure.

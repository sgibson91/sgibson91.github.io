A lot has changed over the last 12 months and I&rsquo;ve come a long way - sometimes surprising myself!</p><h2 id=winter-snowflake>Winter :snowflake:</h2><p>In February, I gave my first professional talk at the <a href=https://cloud.ac.uk/workshops/feb2019/>UKRI Cloud Working Group workshop</a> hosted by The Francis Crick Institute.
It wasn&rsquo;t the furthest I&rsquo;ve travelled for a conference giving it&rsquo;s next door to the British Library, but it was certainly good practice!</p><p>I <a href=https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/conferences/presentations/UKRI_cloud_2019-02-12/UKRI_cloud_demo_2019-02-12.md>gave a presentation</a> on why reproducibility is important in scientific research and how Binder can be used to capture the computational environment so analyses can be reliably re-run.
It involved <a href=https://github.com/binder-examples/matplotlib-versions>live demonstrations of Binder launches</a>, which was quite nerve-wracking!</p><h2 id=spring-tulip>Spring :tulip:</h2><p>As we moved into spring, the workshops ramped up!</p><p><a href=https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way><em>The Turing Way</em></a> ran <strong>three</strong> workshops in March alone!
Two for researchers who&rsquo;d like to use Binder and one for RSEs who may want to run a BinderHub as a service for researchers.
Preparing for the BinderHub workshop was particularly challenging as deploying one wasn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;d been successful at yet!
Thankfully, a breakthrough was made with enough time to write the workshop.</p><p>Next on the list was <a href=https://software.ac.uk/cw19>Collaborations Workshop 2019</a> hosted by the <a href=https://software.ac.uk/>Software Sustainability Institute</a>.
This was a fascinating event for me to attend as it was the first time I interacted with open source/research/science concepts outside of Project Binder and <em>The Turing Way</em>.
It was extra special as <a href=https://twitter.com/PHerterich/status/1113090148143714304>we officially launched the book part of <em>The Turing Way</em></a> at CW19, and <a href=https://twitter.com/mybinderteam/status/1141448994821955584>I was invited to join the mybinder.org operating team</a> as well!</p><p>In May, I attended the <a href=https://research-software-reactor.github.io/blog/rsr0>Microsoft Research Software Reactor Sprint</a> and lead a team to develop the <a href=https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/binderhub-deploy>One-Click deployment BinderHub</a>!
You can read all about it in my blog post [&ldquo;Diving into Leadership to Build Push-Button Code&rdquo;]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url blog/2019-10-17-diving-into-leadership %}).
Then the last event of spring was a <a href=https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/workshops/book-dash><em>Turing Way</em> Book Dash</a> :books::dash: during which I wrote <em>an entire chapter</em> :scream: on <a href=https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/binderhub/binderhub.html>BinderHub</a>!</p><h2 id=summer-sunny>Summer :sunny:</h2><p>Thankfully, summer involved a lot less travelling and presenting.
I was able to enjoy some of the good weather :sunglasses:
However, the hard work didn&rsquo;t stop!
I was working away to produce the next round of workshops coming up in the autumn!
I also began working on some very exciting plans for the <a href=https://blog.jupyter.org/the-international-binder-federation-4f6235c1537e>Binder Federation</a>!</p><h2 id=autumn-maple_leaf>Autumn :maple_leaf:</h2><p>In autumn, I travelled again for some more workshops.</p><p>First off was a <a href=https://twitter.com/drsarahlgibson/status/1170405261070221312>trip to Oslo to meet some of the Binder team</a> in person!
It was a wonderful experience to be in the same room as this team as we usually collaborate remotely.
Erik and I worked together to enable HTTPS with <code>cert-manager</code> on the Turing&rsquo;s private BinderHub, Hub23.
Sometimes knowledge is more easily transferred from person to person, rather than through a screen.</p><p>Next was <a href=https://rse.ac.uk/conf2019/>RSE Con UK</a> where I was super busy presenting!
I was asked to sit on the &ldquo;RSE Worldwide&rdquo; panel to discuss collaboration across borders and how we achieve this in the Binder team.
And I ran my <a href=https://bit.ly/zero-to-binderhub-workshop>Zero-to-BinderHub</a> workshop again, teaching more people how to deploy BinderHubs on Azure!</p><p>After an incredibly busy year, I also managed to take some time off in autumn and go travelling around the east coast of Australia.
Though I still managed to find time to run an Open Source Dash for the Research Engineering team (this is an afternoon where we work together to contribute to open source projects)!</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center><img src=/images/horse_riding.jpg alt="Horse Riding in Australia"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>I went horseback riding along Cape Tribulation beach in the Daintree Rainforest area of northern Queensland! The horse&rsquo;s name is Basil :sparkling_heart:</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Overall, I&rsquo;m really proud of how my presenting skills and confidence in public speaking have improved over 2019.
Giving workshops and lectures/teaching was never something I imagined I would enjoy or be terribly good at - and yet, I&rsquo;ve completely surprised myself at how wrong I was!
Though absolutely no-one who helped me achieve all of this will be the slightest bit surprised :wink::heart:</p><p>I&rsquo;m very grateful for all the opportunities I&rsquo;ve been given this year to learn, grow and share my new knowledge and experiences.
I can&rsquo;t wait to see what&rsquo;s coming next!</p><p>So I&rsquo;m coming into 2020 like&mldr;</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center><figure><img src=https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kick-new-56b2.gif></figure></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>Johannes Radebe, <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>, BBC 2019</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYSFo-YBaQM">Watch the full routine on YouTube</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class="flex flex-row justify-around my-2"><h3 class="mb-1 mt-1 text-left mr-4"><a href=/blog/diving-into-leadership/ title="Diving Into Leadership to Build Push-Button Code"><i class="nav-menu fas fa-chevron-circle-left"></i></a></h3><h3 class="mb-1 mt-1 text-left ml-4"><a href=/blog/ssi-fellowship/ title="Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship 2020"><i class="nav-menu fas fa-chevron-circle-right"></i></a></h3></div></main><footer class="text-sm text-center border-t border-gray-500 py-6"><p class=markdownify>Copyright Sarah Gibson, 2025</p><p style=font-size:0><i><a href=https://github.com/darshanbaral/aafu>aafu

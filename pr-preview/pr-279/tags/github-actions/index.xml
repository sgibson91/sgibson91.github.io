&lt;p&gt;This blog was &lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/ci-cd-improvements/"&gt;originally posted by 2i2c&lt;/a&gt; and represents a project Sarah lead and developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2i2c manages the configuration and deployment of multiple Kubernetes clusters and JupyterHubs from &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure"&gt;a single open infrastructure repository&lt;/a&gt;.
This is a challenging problem, as it requires us to centralize information about a number of &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; cloud services, and deploy them in an efficient and reliable manner.
Our initial attempt at this had a number of inefficiencies, and we recently completed an overhaul of its configuration and deployment infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How I automated authorised cloud deployments from Pull Requests with GitHub Actions</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/test-this-pr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 19:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/test-this-pr/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog was originally posted on the Jupyter blog: &lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/how-i-automated-authorised-cloud-deployments-from-pull-requests-with-github-actions-13f890538e32"&gt;https://blog.jupyter.org/how-i-automated-authorised-cloud-deployments-from-pull-requests-with-github-actions-13f890538e32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently did some work on the mybinder.org deployment infrastructure to solve a problem with testing Pull Requests before deployment.
It had not been possible to test Pull Requests on our staging deployment because our automated workflows don&amp;rsquo;t have access to secrets.
This resulted in my writing the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sgibson91/test-this-pr-action"&gt;&lt;code&gt;test-this-pr&lt;/code&gt; action&lt;/a&gt; and this blog is a retrospective of what I learned over that process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

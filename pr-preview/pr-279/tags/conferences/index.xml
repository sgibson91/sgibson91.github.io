The following is my round-up of what the event is, who runs it, and some of my highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-ssi"&gt;What is the SSI?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://software.ac.uk/about"&gt;Software Sustainability Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SSI for short) is a network of UK universities, Research Software Engineering groups and policy makers dedicated in improving the quality, sustainability and recognition of research software.
They help the members in their network learn software skills and best practices, and advocate for culture change in their organisations and institutions.
I am also an &lt;a href="https://software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme"&gt;SSI Fellow&lt;/a&gt; and if anyone has any questions about the Fellowship round in the future, please do get in touch (unfortunately, applications have already closed for the 2021 round).
And &lt;a href="https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/ssi-fellowship/" title="Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship 2020"&gt;read my previous blog&lt;/a&gt; to find out more about my Fellowship goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

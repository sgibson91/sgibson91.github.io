This is a challenging problem, as it requires us to centralize information about a number of <em>independent</em> cloud services, and deploy them in an efficient and reliable manner.
Our initial attempt at this had a number of inefficiencies, and we recently completed an overhaul of its configuration and deployment infrastructure.</p></p><a href=/blog/2i2c-ci-cd-improvements/>Read more</a></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

See an example <a href=https://github.com/sgibson91/testing-gh-actions/blob/3a0fec6d59c933646e6c6b673e37cadf1dafb3a2/.github/workflows/includes-matrix-with-list.yaml>here</a>.</li><li>A pattern I often use to update my working branch with the default branch is:<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>git checkout main
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>git pull  <span style=color:#75715e># Add `upstream main` if appropriate</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>git checkout my_branch
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>git merge main
</span></span></code></pre></div>Mostly this is fine, but occasionally merge conflicts happen.
If I know I want to keep a specific version of a conflicting file from one of the branches (as opposed to finding a non-conflicting combination), <a href=https://nitaym.github.io/ourstheirs/><code>--theirs/--ours</code></a> can be used.<pre tabindex=0><code>git checkout --ours conflicting_filename  # To keep the version from the current branch
git checkout --theirs conflicting_filename  # To keep the file from the incoming branch
</code></pre>Note that behaviour can change depending on which branch is checked out and whether a merge or rebase is being performed, so I recommend to double-check online!</li><li>That the second <code>---</code> in YAML delimits as if what follows it is another YAML file.
This can cause issues for command line YAML parsers like <code>yq</code> and made pulling the front matter from my Markdown files a little trickier than expected!</li><li>How to automatically tweet out new blog posts when they are merged into <code>main</code></li><li>How to use a GitHub App to generate tokens in GitHub Action workflows.
The tokens can then be used to securely workaround the fact that GitHub Action workflows can&rsquo;t be triggered by events that were authorised by the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> in another workflow.
There is a nice write-up that helped me <a href=https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/main/docs/concepts-guidelines.md#authenticating-with-github-app-generated-tokens>here</a>.</li></ul></p></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

It had not been possible to test Pull Requests on our staging deployment because our automated workflows don&rsquo;t have access to secrets.
This resulted in my writing the <a href=https://github.com/sgibson91/test-this-pr-action><code>test-this-pr</code> action</a> and this blog is a retrospective of what I learned over that process.</p></p><a href=/blog/test-this-pr/>Read more</a></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

So this blog post will be a quick run down on everything I&rsquo;ve been up to recently.</p><p>At the start of January, I helped organise and run the <a href=https://research-software-reactor.github.io/>Research Software Reactor</a> with <a href=https://twitter.com/ixek>Tania Allard</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/gerardjgorman>Gerard Gorman</a>.
Our topic was &ldquo;<a href=https://research-software-reactor.github.io/blog/devops4rse>DevOps for better software and research reproducibility</a>&rdquo;.
We had around 30 attendees come together at the Turing Institute for 2 days and learn about <a href=https://github.com/features/actions>GitHub Actions</a> for automating their workflows.
The aim was to produce reproducible software to support gold-standard research.</p></p><a href=/blog/february-2020-update/>Read more</a></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

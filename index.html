2i2c manages the configuration and deployment of multiple Kubernetes clusters and JupyterHubs from a single open infrastructure repository. This is a challenging problem, as it requires us to centralize information about a number of independent cloud services, and deploy them in an efficient and reliable manner. Our initial attempt at this had a number of inefficiencies, and we recently completed an overhaul of its configuration and deployment infrastructure.</p><a href=/blog/2i2c-ci-cd-improvements/>Read more</a></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

See an example here. A pattern I often use to update my working branch with the default branch is: git checkout main git pull # Add `upstream main` if appropriate git checkout my_branch git merge main Mostly this is fine, but occasionally merge conflicts happen. If I know I want to keep a specific version of a conflicting file from one of the branches (as opposed to finding a non-conflicting combination), --theirs/--ours can be used. git checkout --ours conflicting_filename # To keep the version from the current branch git checkout --theirs conflicting_filename # To keep the file from the incoming branch Note that behaviour can change depending on which branch is checked out and whether a merge or rebase is being performed, so I recommend to double-check online! That the second --- in YAML delimits as if what follows it is another YAML file. This can cause issues for command line YAML parsers like yq and made pulling the front matter from my Markdown files a little trickier than expected! How to automatically tweet out new blog posts when they are merged into main How to use a GitHub App to generate tokens in GitHub Action workflows. The tokens can then be used to securely workaround the fact that GitHub Action workflows can&rsquo;t be triggered by events that were authorised by the GITHUB_TOKEN in another workflow. There is a nice write-up that helped me here.</p></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

I recently did some work on the mybinder.org deployment infrastructure to solve a problem with testing Pull Requests before deployment. It had not been possible to test Pull Requests on our staging deployment because our automated workflows don&rsquo;t have access to secrets. This resulted in my writing the test-this-pr action and this blog is a retrospective of what I learned over that process.</p><a href=/blog/test-this-pr/>Read more</a></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

The following is my round-up of what the event is, who runs it, and some of my highlights.
What is the SSI? The Software Sustainability Institute (SSI for short) is a network of UK universities, Research Software Engineering groups and policy makers dedicated in improving the quality, sustainability and recognition of research software. They help the members in their network learn software skills and best practices, and advocate for culture change in their organisations and institutions. I am also an SSI Fellow and if anyone has any questions about the Fellowship round in the future, please do get in touch (unfortunately, applications have already closed for the 2021 round). And read my previous blog to find out more about my Fellowship goals.</p><a href=/blog/collabw21/>Read more</a></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

However in their current roles, they often find themselves using the same tools, for example Continuous Integration. They have written this blog post to identify how academia and industry may use Continuous Integration in different ways, and what they might learn from one another.
What is Continuous Integration and why do we use it? In Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), the key concept is &ldquo;continuous&rdquo;. That is where it departs from what software engineering teams were doing before: rather than eventually integrating, at the end of developing a feature, we do it continuously, as we&rsquo;re working. Instead of eventually deploying, when we&rsquo;ve got a collection of features built and bugs fixed, we do it continuously.</p><a href=/blog/continuous-integration/>Read more</a></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

So this blog post will be a quick run down on everything I&rsquo;ve been up to recently.
At the start of January, I helped organise and run the Research Software Reactor with Tania Allard and Gerard Gorman. Our topic was &ldquo;DevOps for better software and research reproducibility&rdquo;. We had around 30 attendees come together at the Turing Institute for 2 days and learn about GitHub Actions for automating their workflows. The aim was to produce reproducible software to support gold-standard research.</p><a href=/blog/february-2020-update/>Read more</a></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

The Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) is an organisation that facilitates the advancement of software in research by cultivating better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research (“Better software, better research”). Its mission is to become the world-leading hub for research software practice. The Institute is based at the Universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford and Southampton, and draws on a team of experts with a breadth of experience in software development, project and programme management, research facilitation, publicity and community engagement.</p><a href=/blog/ssi-fellowship/>Read more</a></div><div class=post__footer><em class="fas fa-calendar-day"></em>

As a scientist in today's ever connected, digital world, having a platform to talk about one's work can be a really useful tool.
Whether you're looking to strike up new collaborations or promote your freshly published paper, a blog can help signal boost your work and function as an archive of your ideas (the developed and forgotten).

I put together a tutorial for building a blog site from scratch using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - the same tools I use to host this site!

> :information: **The website has moved!**

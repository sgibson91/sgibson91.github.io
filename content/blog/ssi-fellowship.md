So 2020 is off to an incredibly exciting start!

**I have been awarded a Software Sustainability Institute 2020 Fellowship!!!** :tada: :tada: :tada:

The [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk) (SSI) is an organisation that facilitates the advancement of software in research by cultivating better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research (“Better software, better research”).
Its mission is to become the world-leading hub for research software practice.
The Institute is based at the Universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford and Southampton, and draws on a team of experts with a breadth of experience in software development, project and programme management, research facilitation, publicity and community engagement.

Every year, the SSI runs a [fellowship programme](https://software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme) that provides funding for researchers who want to improve how research software is used in their domains/areas of work.

I plan to use my Fellowship to nurture the Binder community, particularly those who use Julia and R languages, and develop an on-ramp process for onboarding new [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) operators.
Hopefully, I'll get to attend the [European R Users Meeting](http://2020.erum.io/) and [JuliaCon](https://juliacon.org/2020/) and listen to the hopes and dreams of these sections of our community for Binder.
I also hope to work with [_The Turing Way_](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) to host a "Train the Trainer"-style do-athon for educators who may want to use Binder for their courses and encourage them the contribute documentation or bug fixes back.

I'm really excited and privileged to be a part of this programme and have the opportunity to collaborate with a great group of Fellows!
And stay tuned for more blog posts on what I get up to as a Fellow over the next year!

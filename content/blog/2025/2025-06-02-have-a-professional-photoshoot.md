In March 2025, I visited Dubai with some friends as we are all clients of the same personal trainer - [Louise Frances](https://www.instagram.com/_francesfitness/).
Lou lives in Dubai and held a client photoshoot for us to show off our progress.
This involved weeks of gruelling prep, hard hours in the gym, low calories, and a high step count to make sure we were looking at our absolute best and felt as confident as we possibly could in our chosen outfits.

This kind of training, by the way, is not a sustainable way to lose weight!
We may have looked our best, but we were also miserable.
My friend and I were literally in a fever dream where all we could talk about for weeks was the food and carbs we were gonna eat once the shoot was over! 😂

All our hard work culminated in a 4 hour photoshoot in a villa in the suburbs of Dubai.
It was very fun, and kind of reminded me of my younger years as a [performing dancer]({{% relref "/blog/2024/2024-09-28-attend-the-ballet" %}}).
All the girls frantically running around backstage, half-dressed, looking for shoes, so-and-so’s supposed to be *on*!
All the girls (and one guy 😆) brought their favourite foods to eat once the shoot was over (mine was chocolate biscuits, the fanciest varieties) and even some (alcohol-free) bubbles!

And here are the results!

In the winter of 2019, I took a month-long trip in Australia travelling the whole east coast from Melbourne up to Cairns.
A chunk of this trip I did as part of an organised group tour, which included snorkelling experiences in the [Whitsunday Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitsunday_Islands) (off the coast of Brisbane) and on the [Great Barrier Reef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef) (off the coast of Cairns).

This was a fantastic experience that exposed me to a wild range of wildlife, from wrass to parrotfish, from giant clams to rays - and I’ll never forget swimming alongside a turtle!

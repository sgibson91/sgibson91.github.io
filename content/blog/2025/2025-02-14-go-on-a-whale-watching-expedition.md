One of my favourite parts of travelling is experiencing the local wildlife and ecosystems of wherever I am.
One way I’ve done this is by taking whale watching tours.

One I took in Australia back in 2010 turned out to be very special.
We came across a rare Southern Right whale with a newborn calf very close to shore.
This species of whale is incredibly rare as their name was given to them since they were considered to be the right (as in correct) whale to hunt during the peak of the whale hunting industry in the area 😒
This was such a big deal that local news crews actually came out to cover the event, and local conservationists began cordoning off the area to ensure the mother and baby weren’t disturbed.

More recently in 2024, I took a whale watching tour from Tromsø, Norway, and got to see a large pod of orca and a humpback whale breach very close to our boat!

Unfortunately, during this trip I had forgotten that I do not possess any “sea legs” whatsoever and spent a fair amount of time green-faced 😬
This may go without saying, but it is also much tougher to withstand standing out on deck during the Arctic winter than an Australian summer!
So I didn’t get quite as many photos as I would have liked.

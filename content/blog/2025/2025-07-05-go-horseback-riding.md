On my [2019 trip to Australia]({{% relref "/blog/2025/2025-01-11-go-snorkelling-or-scuba-diving" %}}), I took a horse-riding experience on [Cape Tribulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Tribulation,_Queensland) beach north of [Cairns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairns) in the [Daintree rainforest national park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daintree_Rainforest).

I am by no means an experienced rider, or a rider at all 😂 but these were very experienced trail horses who knew exactly the route they were going to take and stuck to each other.
The only direction we needed to give them was to pull their heads up so they couldn’t eat the grass!
“They’re given enough hay back at the farm, and they are just greedy!” 😂
But it turns out horses heads are heavy and I was not successful in my endeavours.
My horse was called Basil and he was very interested in eating grass, and less interested in posing nicely for photographs 😂

Overall, this was a fun experience, and a different way to experience a slice of Australia’s coastline - definitely something I’d do again.

Given my musical background, I’ve seen many an orchestra concert - and indeed even played in a couple myself!

One of the standout concerts for me though, was seeing my favourite band [Alter Bridge](https://alterbridge.com/) at one of two special performances at the [Royal Albert Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Albert_Hall) with the [Parallax Orchestra](https://parallaxorchestra.com/).
The performances were recorded for a special [live album](https://open.spotify.com/album/1UGAQSEHGI0bf4NrOwPUli?si=JsEuH7r5R5Wc-qmcZ1Ep7g) and [DVD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEy5j7FiaC0) release.

I am actually a massive musical theatre fan having performed on-stage as part of my [dance school]({{% relref "/blog/2024/2024-09-28-attend-the-ballet" %}}), and regularly attended the theatre with my grandma growing up.
I then lived in London for a few years, so I have seen many a musical, both iconic and newer, on- and off-West End.

My favourite though will always be the Lion King.
There is just something about this production that does more than bring the movie to life (a favourite when I was growing up!) but also the representation of African culture woven into every aspect of the design and performance.
A truly breath-taking show that I would go and see over and over again.

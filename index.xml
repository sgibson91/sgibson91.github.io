This is a challenging problem, as it requires us to centralize information about a number of<em>independent</em> cloud services, and deploy them in an efficient and reliable manner.
Our initial attempt at this had a number of inefficiencies, and we recently completed an overhaul of its configuration and deployment infrastructure.</p></description></item><item><title>Things I've Learned: January 2022</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/til-jan22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/til-jan22/</guid><description>An Unordered Collection of Things I Learn over a Month</description></item><item><title>How I automated authorised cloud deployments from Pull Requests with GitHub Actions</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/test-this-pr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 19:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/test-this-pr/</guid><description><blockquote><p>This blog was originally posted on the Jupyter blog:<a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/how-i-automated-authorised-cloud-deployments-from-pull-requests-with-github-actions-13f890538e32">https://blog.jupyter.org/how-i-automated-authorised-cloud-deployments-from-pull-requests-with-github-actions-13f890538e32</a></p></blockquote><p>I recently did some work on the mybinder.org deployment infrastructure to solve a problem with testing Pull Requests before deployment.
It had not been possible to test Pull Requests on our staging deployment because our automated workflows don&rsquo;t have access to secrets.
This resulted in my writing the<a href="https://github.com/sgibson91/test-this-pr-action"><code>test-this-pr</code> action</a> and this blog is a retrospective of what I learned over that process.</p></description></item><item><title>Create a Blog with Hugo and GitHub Pages</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/hugo-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:28:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/hugo-tutorial/</guid><description><p>As a scientist in today&rsquo;s ever connected, digital world, having a platform to talk about one&rsquo;s work can be a really useful tool.

It feels like such a long time since I wrote a blog post but the truth is that I&rsquo;ve just been up to so many exciting things!
So this blog post will be a quick run down on everything I&rsquo;ve been up to recently.</p><p>At the start of January, I helped organise and run the<a href="https://research-software-reactor.github.io/">Research Software Reactor</a> with<a href="https://twitter.com/ixek">Tania Allard</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/gerardjgorman">Gerard Gorman</a>.
Our topic was &ldquo;<a href="https://research-software-reactor.github.io/blog/devops4rse">DevOps for better software and research reproducibility</a>&rdquo;.
We had around 30 attendees come together at the Turing Institute for 2 days and learn about<a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> for automating their workflows.
The aim was to produce reproducible software to support gold-standard research.</p></description></item><item><title>Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship 2020</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/ssi-fellowship/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/ssi-fellowship/</guid><description><p>So 2020 is off to an incredibly exciting start!</p><p><strong>I have been awarded a Software Sustainability Institute 2020 Fellowship!!!</strong> &#x1f389; &#x1f389; &#x1f389;</p><p>The<a href="https://software.ac.uk">Software Sustainability Institute</a> (SSI) is an organisation that facilitates the advancement of software in research by cultivating better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research (“Better software, better research”).
Its mission is to become the world-leading hub for research software practice.
The Institute is based at the Universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford and Southampton, and draws on a team of experts with a breadth of experience in software development, project and programme management, research facilitation, publicity and community engagement.</p></description></item><item><title>2019: Seasons of Reflection</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/seasons-of-reflection/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/seasons-of-reflection/</guid><description><p>As 2019 comes to a close, I have spent a full year as a Research Software Engineer (RSE) at The Alan Turing Institute.

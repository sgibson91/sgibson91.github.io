      <description>While managing BinderHubs, I found that there were a lot of things I had to deal with manually and, inevitably, I failed to keep on top of them. Most notably, the two biggest problems I faced were i) keeping my BinderHub up-to-date with the latest software released by the Binder team, and ii) keeping the size of the image registry manageable and within budget.
Hence I developed HelmUpgradeBot!
Keeping software up-to-date The first problem I wanted to solve was the manual updates I had to perform to keep my BinderHub up-to-date with the software the Binder team releases, packaged as a Helm Chart.</description>

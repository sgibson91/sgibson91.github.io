This is a challenging problem, as it requires us to centralize information about a number of<em>independent</em> cloud services, and deploy them in an efficient and reliable manner.
Our initial attempt at this had a number of inefficiencies, and we recently completed an overhaul of its configuration and deployment infrastructure.</p></description></item><item><title>How I automated authorised cloud deployments from Pull Requests with GitHub Actions</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/test-this-pr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 19:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/test-this-pr/</guid><description><blockquote><p>This blog was originally posted on the Jupyter blog:<a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/how-i-automated-authorised-cloud-deployments-from-pull-requests-with-github-actions-13f890538e32">https://blog.jupyter.org/how-i-automated-authorised-cloud-deployments-from-pull-requests-with-github-actions-13f890538e32</a></p></blockquote><p>I recently did some work on the mybinder.org deployment infrastructure to solve a problem with testing Pull Requests before deployment.
It had not been possible to test Pull Requests on our staging deployment because our automated workflows don&rsquo;t have access to secrets.
This resulted in my writing the<a href="https://github.com/sgibson91/test-this-pr-action"><code>test-this-pr</code> action</a> and this blog is a retrospective of what I learned over that process.</p></description></item><item><title>Create a Blog with Hugo and GitHub Pages</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/hugo-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:28:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/hugo-tutorial/</guid><description><p>As a scientist in today&rsquo;s ever connected, digital world, having a platform to talk about one&rsquo;s work can be a really useful tool.

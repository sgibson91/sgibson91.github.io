&lt;p&gt;And it is cool. &lt;em&gt;Really&lt;/em&gt; cool! But also a bit scary as a room full of Research Software Engineers (each of them much further on in their careers than I am) suddenly turn to me, eager for the knowledge I was surely about to impart to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

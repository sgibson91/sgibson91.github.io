      <description>I have spoken on reproducible research and open source collaboration at high profile software conferences in the UK. I am also comfortable and experienced at leading workshops/tutorials for all ranges of abilities.
I am always happy to attend and speak at conferences, and I really enjoy sharing my knowledge with new audiences. I am grateful to all the conference organisers who have done a wonderful job hosting me so far. 👐</description>

2i2c manages the configuration and deployment of multiple Kubernetes clusters and JupyterHubs from a single open infrastructure repository. This is a challenging problem, as it requires us to centralize information about a number of independent cloud services, and deploy them in an efficient and reliable manner. Our initial attempt at this had a number of inefficiencies, and we recently completed an overhaul of its configuration and deployment infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>How I automated authorised cloud deployments from Pull Requests with GitHub Actions</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/test-this-pr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 19:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/test-this-pr/</guid><description>This blog was originally posted on the Jupyter blog: https://blog.jupyter.org/how-i-automated-authorised-cloud-deployments-from-pull-requests-with-github-actions-13f890538e32
I recently did some work on the mybinder.org deployment infrastructure to solve a problem with testing Pull Requests before deployment. It had not been possible to test Pull Requests on our staging deployment because our automated workflows don&amp;rsquo;t have access to secrets. This resulted in my writing the test-this-pr action and this blog is a retrospective of what I learned over that process.</description></item></channel></rss>

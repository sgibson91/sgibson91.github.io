&lt;p>This blog was &lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/ci-cd-improvements/">originally posted by 2i2c&lt;/a> and represents a project Sarah lead and developed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>2i2c manages the configuration and deployment of multiple Kubernetes clusters and JupyterHubs from &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure">a single open infrastructure repository&lt;/a>.
This is a challenging problem, as it requires us to centralize information about a number of &lt;em>independent&lt;/em> cloud services, and deploy them in an efficient and reliable manner.
Our initial attempt at this had a number of inefficiencies, and we recently completed an overhaul of its configuration and deployment infrastructure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How I automated authorised cloud deployments from Pull Requests with GitHub Actions</title><link>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/test-this-pr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 19:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sgibson91.github.io/blog/test-this-pr/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>I recently did some work on the mybinder.org deployment infrastructure to solve a problem with testing Pull Requests before deployment.
It had not been possible to test Pull Requests on our staging deployment because our automated workflows don&amp;rsquo;t have access to secrets.
This resulted in my writing the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sgibson91/test-this-pr-action">&lt;code>test-this-pr&lt;/code> action&lt;/a> and this blog is a retrospective of what I learned over that process.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

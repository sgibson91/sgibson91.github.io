However in their current roles, they often find themselves using the same tools, for example Continuous Integration. They have written this blog post to identify how academia and industry may use Continuous Integration in different ways, and what they might learn from one another.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), the key concept is &amp;ldquo;continuous&amp;rdquo;. That is where it departs from what software engineering teams were doing before: rather than &lt;em>eventually&lt;/em> integrating, at the end of developing a feature, we do it &lt;em>continuously&lt;/em>, as we&amp;rsquo;re working. Instead of &lt;em>eventually&lt;/em> deploying, when we&amp;rsquo;ve got a collection of features built and bugs fixed, we do it &lt;em>continuously&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
